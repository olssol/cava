In the development of cancer vaccines, phase II clinical studies examine the
efficacy of a vaccine at the optimal dosage determined in the corresponding
phase I studies in order to screen out vaccines with poor activities. Because of
its simplicity and ethical considerations, Simon's two-stage design and its
variations are popular tools for designing cancer phase II clinical studies.
Outcomes from different patients are typically assumed independent from each
other in Simon's two-stage design. For cancer vaccine studies, immune responses
from multiple patients are usually measured as batches. In the presence of batch
effects, the outcomes are correlated with each other. Thus, the independence
assumption does not hold. In this paper, we conduct simulation studies to
explore the impact of batch effects on phase II studies with Simon's two-stage
design. Furthermore, we propose an adjusted Simon's two-stage design that
accounts for batch effects and evaluate its performance by simulation studies.

Batch effect has long been recognized as a thorny issue for assays
\citep{youden1972enduring}. It can be confounded with the outcomes of interest,
cause significant bias in the measurements, and lead to serious concerns about
the validity of the findings. Although approaches have been proposed to address
batch effects through improved experimental design or statistical adjustments,
These proposals are primarily suitable for high-dimensional assays such as
microarrays, bead chips and next-generation sequencing, where there are enough
data to detect and remove batch effects via sophisticated modeling approaches
\citep{alter2000singular,benito2004adjustment,johnson2007adjusting,leek2010tackling}.
In low-dimensional settings such as clinical trial design and analysis, batch
effect adjustment is often neglected. To the best of our knowledge, research
addressing and mitigating the impact of batch effects on clinical trials is very
limited.

In this paper, we focus on evaluating the impact of batch effects on a specific
clinical trial design: Simon's two-stage design \citep{simon1989optimal}.
Simon's two-stage design allows the investigators to conduct straightforward
interim analysis at the end of the first stage and to stop the study early for
futility. Because of its simplicity and ethical considerations, Simon's
two-stage design is widely adopted in phase II cancer clinical studies. In
Simon's two-stage design, outcomes from different patients are assumed
independent from each other. This independence assumption, however, does not
hold in the presence of batch effects. \cite{sargent1999sample} proposed an
approximation method, hereinafter referred to as the Sargent's method, to adjust
Simon's two-stage design for per-tumor analysis when each patient may have
multiple tumors. We propose a simulation-based batch-effect adjusted Simon's
two-stage design to take into account batch effects at study design. We also
conduct numerical studies to evaluate the performance of the proposal, compare
it with the Sargent's method, and demonstrate it by a therapeutic HPV vaccine
trial. Finally, we have developed statistical software to implement the proposed
design, and a brief introduction to the software is given in the paper.
