Description: This is a clinical trial design software suite for cancer vaccines.
    The package currently includes two major designs for cancer vaccine clinical
    trials. The fist design is a Bayesian Phase I trial design that allows
    simultaneous evaluation of safety and immunogenicity outcomes in the context
    of vaccine studies. See Wang (2019) <DOI:10.1002/sim.8021> for the details
    of the Phase I cancer vaccine trial design. The second design is a
    batch-effect adjusted Simon two-stage design.
