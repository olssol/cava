# Installation

The package **cava** can be installed directly from *CRAN*: 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("cava");
```
Some packages (e.g., *shiny*) are required to run the graphical user interface for *visit***, 
but are not required to run **cava** through a *R* terminal.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
require(cava);
set.seed(10000);
```

# Introduction

This is a clinical trial design software suite for cancer vaccines.
The package currently includes two major designs for cancer vaccine clinical
trials. The fist design is a Bayesian Phase I trial design that allows
simultaneous evaluation of safety and immunogenicity outcomes in the context
of vaccine studies. See Wang (2019) <DOI:10.1002/sim.8021> for the details
of the Phase I cancer vaccine trial design. The second design is a
batch-effect adjusted Simon two-stage design. This package's focus is the 
addition of batch-effect adjusted Simon two-stage design, where batch-effect
is accounted for.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The **cava** package provides a web-based GUI for composite endpoint analysis. 
The GUI includes both **cava** and **visit** packages. The GUI can be accessed by

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
cvShiny();
```
